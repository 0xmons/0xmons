<p> Two things tend to be necessary for knowledge to spread; experience and survival. This makes it very difficult to study the Great Old Ones, as those who do the first enough to have something worth learning tend not to do the second. For the purposes of spreading knowledge, casualties are marked both by death and the loss of sanity, and this means the traditional avenues to gaining and spreading knowledge would be largely fruitless.</p>

<p>Our job as ignotagraphers, then, is largely to perform autopsies. We study the dead, whether dead individuals or groups or nations or worlds, and we do our best to piece together what we can from the manner in which they died.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s easy. <a routerLink="/mon/7">Sturrosh, also called The Bright Oil in the Gulf</a>, tends to end worlds through massive tsunamis, great obsidian pillars rising from the ocean where its breath has touched and displaced entire oceans. <a routerLink="/mon/14">Shudde M’ell, the Worm that Gnaws One’s Roots</a>, leaves its mark on the earth instead, growing and growing until its millions of tentacles and claws and mouths and eyes burst forth from the crust and end whatever civilizations have developed over it, unaware all along of their coming doom.</p>

<p>Other times, such as when studying the corpses left by <a routerLink="/mon/10">G’yathnä, Mistress of Doom</a>, it is much more difficult.</p>

<p>Temples depicting a blue, writhing mass with two heads are often found on worlds where the ending seems more…natural. No single calamity marks her passing, no final day of reckoning. Instead, G’yathnä works through the hands of her victims.</p>

<p>What records are found claim her to be a demonic entity who can appear before men and speak “prophecies,” her voice supposedly placing “curses” on the minds of those who hear her. We have studied many supposed info-hazards throughout the years, and it was in studying G’yathnä that we have tentatively begun to mark a distinction between what we have begun calling the Automatic Infohazard, and the Behavioral Infohazard.</p> 

<p>An Automatic Infohazard works on the mind without action; just reading of it, hearing of it, will, allegedly, cause one to obsess, or have their mental faculties degrade, or be otherwise functionally replaced entirely, a sort of mental overwrite of who they are. It is worth noting the word “allegedly,” there. We have yet to find any evidence of such a thing that rises above the level of mundanely disorienting revelation; that is to say, knowledge which causes one to lose their faith, or experience prolonged existential dread, depression, anxiety, etc. It is understandable that some might be driven to suicide, upon learning these dark truths of the universe, but so long as not everyone does, it seems inaccurate to label them a “true” infohazard.</p>

<p>It is the Behavioral Infohazard that we now believe G’yathnä employs.</p>

<p>In our world, there existed many periods in history where technology and our understanding of the universe was much more limited. Long before we had the ability to visit other worlds, our technological advances grew far beyond our social ones, and for a time the most likely existential threats we faced largely came from ourselves. We created weapons, bombs and diseases, that might have killed us all if they were ever used. We almost changed ourselves beyond recognition, distinguished ourselves into different incompatible species. We almost developed artificial intelligence that would have grown beyond our control. Thankfully, we are one of the lucky worlds that survived each such period in our history… half by virtue, half by luck.</p>

<p>But what if one of us were to go to another world, less developed, and introduce such knowledge at earlier times? Would they have been as lucky? What truths would have led to widespread civilizational collapse, if propagated earlier?</p> 

<p>From what we could piece together, this is how G’yathnä brings the slow and piecemeal destruction of worlds. Spreading knowledge of a deadly and widespreading toxin that could be created with simple household supplies may not be enough, on its own, but would surely change the face of society. Combined with some social or historical truth that feeds conflicts, stirs anger, perpetuates hate from generation to generation, until all is ruin…</p>

<p>It is, in a way, a more frightening thing to contemplate than seas of obsidian and pillars of alien flesh. We ignotagraphers devote ourselves to spreading knowledge, because we believe it the only defense against the unknown dangers of the multiverse. But how sure can we be, that all Truth is Good? Irrespective of context, setting, and time? Irrespective of culture and history?</p>

<p>Darkness seems the source of all evil, but how sure can we be, that we have unearthed all such dangerous truths, and grown mature enough to survive always living in the light?</p>

<p>These questions trouble me more than any other that have arisen in my twenty-six years of service to this cause. To be one that claims to love Truth, but hides it from others, seems a contradiction. Has G’yathnä already appeared in our plane, and spoken to someone? Someone in our order, perhaps? Did they learn some truth so dangerous they kept it to themselves? Or is it written somewhere already, waiting to be read by the wrong person at the right time to bring calamity?</p>

<p>Would I recognize G’yathnä’s words, if I saw them?  What would I do, if the Mistress of Doom appeared before me, and spoke a “cursed truth?”</p>
